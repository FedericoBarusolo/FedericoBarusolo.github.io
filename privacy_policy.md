# Datemark – Privacy Policy

**Last updated: 2025-11-14**

Datemark (“the Extension”) is a Chrome extension designed to automatically extract event information from webpages and help users add these events to their Google Calendar.  
This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and how it is protected.

If you have any questions, you can contact us at: **infodatemark@gmail.com**

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Google Account Information (via OAuth)

When you authenticate with Google, we receive:

- Your Google account ID (unique identifier)
- Your email address
- Permission to add events to your Google Calendar

**We do NOT access:**

- Your emails  
- Your contacts  
- Your files  
- Your calendars other than writing events to the one you select  

We only request the minimum OAuth scopes required to insert events into your Google Calendar.

---

### 1.2 Event Data

When you extract events from a webpage, Datemark processes:

- Event title  
- Date and time  
- Location  
- Any additional structured details found in the page text

This data is processed temporarily to create calendar events.  
Event data is **not sold, shared, or used for advertising**.

---

### 1.3 Usage Data (for usage limits)

We store minimal usage metadata in Google Firestore:

- Your user ID  
- Number of events processed per month  
- Time of last usage reset  

This is used solely to enforce the monthly free tier quota.

---

## 2. How We Use the Information

Your data is used exclusively for:

1. **Creating calendar events** in your Google Calendar  
2. **Providing the extension’s core functionality**, including AI-based event extraction  
3. **Tracking usage limits** to enforce fair usage  
4. **Maintaining and improving the Extension**

We do **not**:

- Sell your data  
- Share your data with third parties  
- Use your data for advertising  
- Use your data to train AI models outside your explicit usage  

---

## 3. Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use Requirements)

Datemark complies with the **Google API Services User Data Policy**, including the **Limited Use** requirements.

Accordingly, the Extension:

- Uses Google user data only to provide or improve the user-facing features described  
- Does not use Google user data for any other purposes  
- Does not transfer Google user data except to execute the user’s requested functionality  
- Does not use Google user data for advertising, profiling, or analytics unrelated to core features  

---

## 4. Data Storage and Security

We store only minimal usage metadata in Google Firestore.

We **do NOT** store:

- Your calendar contents  
- Individual events added to your calendar  
- Webpage content  
- Any personal information beyond what is strictly required for the service

All data stored in Firestore is protected using Google Cloud security standards, including:

- Encrypted storage  
- Secured access via service accounts  
- Strict access rules  

---

## 5. Data Sharing

We do **not** share any personal information with third parties.

We may share aggregated, anonymous metrics (e.g., number of total events processed per month) purely for performance and usage analysis — never identifiable information.

---

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

### 6.1 Retention

We retain:

- Usage metadata (ID + monthly count) until your account is inactive for 12 months

### 6.2 Data Deletion

You can request that all stored data associated with your account be deleted by emailing us at:

📩 **infodatemark@gmail.com**

Your request will be processed within **30 days**.

- **activeTab** – to extract event data from the current webpage  
- **scripting / content scripts** – to analyze webpage content  
- **identity / OAuth** – to authenticate with Google

These permissions are used exclusively to deliver the extension’s functionality.
